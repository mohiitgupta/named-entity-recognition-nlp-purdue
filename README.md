course project on identification of named entity recognition using deep max entropy markov model

The final code is in the folder mohit_gupta.
Kindly take a look at this folder. A detailed analysis is given in hw2.pdf.

Instructions for Running the code are:

python hw2.py

Sample Output after around 12 minutes (as per my personal machine) but may take longer on data.cs.purdue.edu. Last time I check in the night at around 10 pm, it took less than 15 minutes on data.cs.purdue.edu.:

Test Results 90.01 88.58 89.29

Notes:

I have already tuned my hyperparameters as per the validation dataset which I used. The trained model is saved in parameters.pt. The word embeddings are saved in word_embeddings.pt.
